This project uses React to create a beautiful site to highlight the surface geology, internal structure and general overview of the planets in our solar system. My learning was focused on understanding the fundamentals of React as a library. I also focused on creating a responsive yet beautiful site that follows the design specifications given. 


## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I will refactor my components to be more reusale. I already refactored some elements like the buttons, typography, images, etc to be reusable but I would take it a bit further by making my components truly lean and focused. 

## Lessons Learned:

Because this is my first full React project, there are a lot of new technologies that I have learned. Styled Components, props in React, managing state and a lot more. The most interesting thing I learnt however, will be how to use Context API. I plan to dive deeper into the nuances of context API as well as Redux soon.
