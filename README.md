This project uses React, TypeScript and GraphQL to fetch data from the SpaceX API. A figma file was provided which I tried to follow as much as I could


## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I hope to add proper error handling to catch errors that might occur while fetching data from the GraphQL Api

## Challenges Encountered:

I encountered CORS issues while trying to fetch the data from the API. I tried different approaches to bypass the issue but ut lead to further issues. Eventually, I found a very easy to use proxy while perusing a Github Issue. The proxy is at https://corsproxy.io/

## Conclusion:
I had a swell time building completing this tak home. I learnt more about CORS and how to handle it on the client side. This was an amazing learning opportunity
